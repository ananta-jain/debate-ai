Debate AI is a smart, modular system that creates structured arguments, addresses counterarguments, and assesses relevance, all utilizing natural language processing and semantic scoring. This project features: 

🗣️ Argument Generator: Employs GPT-2 to create claim-reason-evidence frameworks based on any debate topic and position. 

🔁 Rebuttal Engine: Provides logical, AI-generated responses to counterarguments. 

📊 Relevance Scorer: Evaluates the semantic connection between the topic and the generated arguments using sentence embeddings. 

🌐 Flask API: A simple web server that offers endpoints for generating arguments and rebuttals. 

🧪 Test Scripts: Example Python scripts for local or remote interaction with the API. 

Whether you're developing a debate simulator, an educational resource, or simply interested in AI-driven reasoning, this project provides a solid and flexible foundation.
